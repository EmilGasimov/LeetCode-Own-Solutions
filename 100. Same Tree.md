# Problem [level: easy]
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 

#### Example 1:

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

#### Example 2:
```

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
 ```

#### Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
```

# Solution [own; based on breadth-first search]
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} p
 * @param {TreeNode} q
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isSameTree = function(p, q) {
    queue_p = [p];
    queue_q = [q];
    while (queue_p || queue_q) {
        eject_p = queue_p.shift();
        eject_q = queue_q.shift();
        if (eject_p && eject_q && eject_p.val != eject_q.val) {
            return false;
        }
        if ((eject_p && !eject_q) || (!eject_p && eject_q)) {
            return false;
        }
        if (eject_p) {
            queue_p.push(eject_p.left);
            queue_p.push(eject_p.right);
        }
        if (eject_q) {
            queue_q.push(eject_q.left);
            queue_q.push(eject_q.right);
        }
        if (eject_p === undefined && eject_q === undefined) {
            break;
        }
    }    
    return true;
};
```
```
Time Complexity: O(max(m, n)), where m, n are the number of nodes in the trees.
Space Complexity: O(max(m, n)).
